# MagicMirrorAzAz

this is an early test project. This repository will be used to house all the code necessary for my custom magic mirror project, along with any other dependencies. I decdied not to use Magic Mirror Modules (for now) and do form scratch for my own learning, and for more efficient backend interactions, as I have grand plans for this.
