# MagicMirrorAzAz

This is an early test project. This repository will be used to house all the code necessary for my custom magic mirror project, along with any other dependencies. I've decided not to use existing Magic Mirror Modules (for now), insgead opting to recreate most modules from scratch. This will be done primarily for my own learning, as well as more efficient backend interactions.

I am currently still in the early stages, designing and implementing the mirror functionality. After I get back to campus, I plan to order the parts and physically construct the mirror.

summary.txt contains more technical information, as well as instructions for how to run.
todo.txt lists some of my future plans.
